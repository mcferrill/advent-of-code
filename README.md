# Advent of Code

Coding puzzles running from December 1-25. See [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com).

## 2023: Go

This was my first year participating, though I revisited some 2020 puzzles as a warmup.
Decided to do go rather than my original plan of python and then go so it'll hopefully be a better learning experience in a language I'm less familiar with.

## 2024: Typescript + bun

Optimistically this should be a bit easier, but I could use some good reps on my TS skills for future projects.
